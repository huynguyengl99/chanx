User Guide
==========
This user guide provides detailed information about each component of Chanx and how to use them effectively in your applications.

Core Components
---------------
Chanx consists of several core components that work together to provide a comprehensive WebSocket framework:


1. **WebSocket Consumers**: Base consumer classes with authentication, messages, and group handling
2. **Message System**: Pydantic-based message validation and routing
3. **Authentication**: DRF-style authentication for WebSocket connections
4. **Testing**: Specialized tools for testing WebSocket endpoints
5. **Playground**: Interactive UI for exploring and testing WebSocket endpoints
